Research project **Economic Feasibility of Glasshouse Tomato Production in China â€” a Bio-economic Stochastic Modelling Approach**

### Context
In the stage of agricultural modernization, glasshouses investments are booming in China. From 2016 to 2018, the newly built glasshouses reached 400 hectares, with a total investment value of seven billion RMB. Despite the increasing investments, little is known about the economic feasibilities and uncertainties of glasshouse investments in China. 

### Objective
The study aimed to assess the economic feasibility and the associated uncertainties of an investment in a Venlo-type glasshouse for cherry tomato production in four Chinese regions: Jinshan (East China), Langfang (North China), Weifang (East China), and Pingliang (Northwest China), with different climate and market conditions.
